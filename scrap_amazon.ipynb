It does everything I need and nothing I don’t. Where other wearables try to dazzle with features that rarely see real-world use, the Balance keeps things focused, efficient, and incredibly user-friendly. What stands out most is its exceptional battery life. Compared to my Samsung Watch 6 Classic, it’s no contest. While I was used to charging every day or two, the Balance easily lasts over a week on a single charge. That makes it ideal for extended trips with no charger anxiety and no proprietary cables to fuss over. Just freedom. It is also remarkably lightweight, to the point that I forget it’s even on. That makes it the perfect sleep companion with no bulky wrist presence or discomfort in bed. And despite its featherlight feel, it doesn’t skimp on looks. The sleek, understated design is polished enough for professional settings, stylish enough for social events like weddings, and durable enough for a hard workout at the gym. The wristband it comes with (silver model) is cheesy and not my style at all but thankfully an Amazon seller has a silicone band that is utterly perfect, and even fills in the gaps that most bands leave open...making it look like it comes with the way (more than the actual factory band). In short, the Amazfit Balance is the rare smartwatch that delivers exactly what matters: excellent tracking, long battery life, and true everyday wearability, without the clutter. It’s a quietly capable watch that fits any occasion and never gets in the way. Its my favorite smartwatch amongst all I've ever owned...cant wait for the 2nd gen.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"reviewTime\": \"29 June 2025\", \"catergory\": \"Smartwatches\"}\n",
      "{\"reviewerID\": \"R1CLEVMX8ICDMB\", \"reviewerName\": \"nightsmusic\", \"helpful\": [54, 0], \"reviewText\": \"I've had some heart issues for a long time and this past year, they've gotten to the point where I need to do closer monitoring. Then, in July, I had a loop monitor implanted. While it sends a reading to my cardiologist's office every night, I needed something that would alert me when my heart rate fell above or below the doctor's parameters for my situation. I did a lot of research into a lot of watches. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so looked at the Galaxy watches and tried one, but the battery life is terrible. I needed a watch that had a battery that would last more than 12 hours with constant heart monitoring. I was already using an Amazfit GTS 4 Mini and loved it, the battery lasted almost 14 days, but it had no alert for heart rate and also was missing a couple other things I wanted/needed, so after looking at so-many-watches, I decided to try the Balance. So here's my review. The watch is large. At least for me, but the screen is amazing! Clear, easy to read, Amoled so the color is great. I chose to use the 'use your own photo' watch face which is new (I think) for Amazfit and I like it. There are several others to choose from and if they stay true to form, more will be added. There are a lot of apps pre-loaded on the watch and a lot to choose from to load so that would probably appeal to many who will use this for fitness. I do not so I can't speak to the fitness portion of the watch. I keep track of my steps/activity on the whole, but not any specific exercise. I got the watch on September 2nd, charged it, and with all of the heart associated apps turned on to run all the time (including running the heart rate monitor every 60 seconds,) I didn't have to charge it until the 11th, and even then, I was still at 18%, but we were going on vacation, so the battery life is great. Like I mentioned, the watch is huge, at least for me. It's 46mm, but light weight, so I don't really notice it much. It has a relatively slim profile on the wrist so I'm not banging into things with it like I thought I would. I did change the band to a stainless steel one because any silicone bands cause a rash for me. Those are the basics. Here's some of the pros and cons. PROS: Huge, clear, bright face that's easy to read, even for people who need glasses. Several watch faces to choose from including one you can personalize. Big plus! Heart/Health monitoring has been pretty accurate so far as tested at the cardiologist's office Sleep monitoring seems to be accurate, matching those times I wake during the night Will follow DND on your phone Will sync with Google Fit and a couple other third party health apps now Different sounds per alerts so you know what alerts are coming in (can't change them though) Syncs well with Zepp app and changes on app are immediate on watch Silicone band will fit a 5-1/2\\\" to 10\\\"+ wrist CONS: NO ECG. None of the watches Amazfit sells in the US has ECG. That was the first question I asked them and from their response, for the foreseeable future, they will not have a watch in the US that has that. The winder is very large and really sits high on the watch. It has the potential to catch on things and does during the night so if you use DND and wear it to bed, it will catch on the sheets at some point, wake the watch, waking you. No tap-to-wake, which my GT4 Mini had and which I miss a lot. It will still 'lift to wake' if you set that, otherwise, you have to push the winder. Second button on the watch is for workout information which I don't use, but it's very flat and seems like it would be hard to use while very active. \\\"Rotate the crown\\\" must mean the winder because the crown doesn't rotate and while the winder does, it only makes the face larger and not permanently Takes a 22mm watch band! Don't make the mistake of buying a 20mm which is a standard size. BEWARE! I went a whole day without getting any notifications. I reached out to Amazfit and they had no idea why I wasn't getting any either. Low and behold, there's an option called Cover To Mute. If that's checked and you're wearing a long sleeve shirt or sweater that covers the watch, you won't receive any notifications because the face is covered. Just letting you know! That's a flyover of the watch. On the whole, I like it. I've never been a big fan of the Zepp world. I'd be a lot happier if it was Android OS of course, but I understand their desire to work with either Android or Apple. They're getting smoother with the interaction between their OS and Android though. I'm sure I've missed a bunch, but this will give you a good idea at least.\", \"overall\": 5.0, \"reviewTime\": \"17 September 2024\", \"catergory\": \"Smartwatches\"}\n",

I have had this smart watch for 7 days and have noticed a huge upgrade in the performance of the health tracking sensors over the GTR 3. All of the health metrics are more accurate and more reliable and there are more on this watch compared to the GTR 3. I really like the addition of the body composition detection (but strongly recommend getting a mat to give a full body scan). I also like the addition of the skin temperature sensor which is absolutely spot on as it can give an indication of your general health and if you are running the risk of heat exhaustion or hypothermia, it also tracks your sleeping temperature and gives feedback of your overall sleep quality along with the standard sleep cycle tracking, oxygen levels, sleep apnea or hyponea tracking. The heart sensor is more accurate and offers continuous heart rate tracking while exercising, resting heart rate tracking, and heart rate variability while sleeping to give a better indication of overall heart health. Now this watch also includes a readiness score based on 2 metrics, physical recovery and mental recovery based on physical activity from the day before and how well you slept overnight. There are so many features on this watch that I would literally have to right a novel to explain them all. I do like the that I can answer and make phone calls directly from the watch (via Bluetooth) and the fact that there is several ways to reply to text messages (that now show recieved images). You can do a quick response, use the built-in keyboard, or use the Zepp Flow assistant to type your speech to text, and it's very accurate at converting your speech to text. I have also found out that Amazfit is working on a blood pressure algorithm for this watch that will be brought out shortly. The GPS tracking is absolutely spot on in my tests and acquires a lock very fast. I appreciate the quality of this watch in both fit and finish with its large amoled display that has a maximum brightness of 1500 nits, easy to see even in direct sunlight (similar brightness to the Google Pixel 8 phone that I use). I honestly haven't seen a better smartwatch for the price made by anyone else, and the fact that it runs on Android and iOS only makes it more versatile.

I'd prefer auto recognising exercise but the missing features are reflected in the price. Fits well. I like the idea of adding a photo for the background but it is only 1 photo unfortunately.For the money this watch seems pretty spot on.

       "  'reviewText': \"The Amazfit Balance is, without question, one of the most practical smartwatches I’ve ever owned. It does everything I need and nothing I don’t. Where other wearables try to dazzle with features that rarely see real-world use, the Balance keeps things focused, efficient, and incredibly user-friendly. What stands out most is its exceptional battery life. Compared to my Samsung Watch 6 Classic, it’s no contest. While I was used to charging every day or two, the Balance easily lasts over a week on a single charge. That makes it ideal for extended trips with no charger anxiety and no proprietary cables to fuss over. Just freedom. It is also remarkably lightweight, to the point that I forget it’s even on. That makes it the perfect sleep companion with no bulky wrist presence or discomfort in bed. And despite its featherlight feel, it doesn’t skimp on looks. The sleek, understated design is polished enough for professional settings, stylish enough for social events like weddings, and durable enough for a hard workout at the gym. The wristband it comes with (silver model) is cheesy and not my style at all but thankfully an Amazon seller has a silicone band that is utterly perfect, and even fills in the gaps that most bands leave open...making it look like it comes with the way (more than the actual factory band). In short, the Amazfit Balance is the rare smartwatch that delivers exactly what matters: excellent tracking, long battery life, and true everyday wearability, without the clutter. It’s a quietly capable watch that fits any occasion and never gets in the way. Its my favorite smartwatch amongst all I've ever owned...cant wait for the 2nd gen.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve had some heart issues for a long time and this past year, they\\'ve gotten to the point where I need to do closer monitoring. Then, in July, I had a loop monitor implanted. While it sends a reading to my cardiologist\\'s office every night, I needed something that would alert me when my heart rate fell above or below the doctor\\'s parameters for my situation. I did a lot of research into a lot of watches. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so looked at the Galaxy watches and tried one, but the battery life is terrible. I needed a watch that had a battery that would last more than 12 hours with constant heart monitoring. I was already using an Amazfit GTS 4 Mini and loved it, the battery lasted almost 14 days, but it had no alert for heart rate and also was missing a couple other things I wanted/needed, so after looking at so-many-watches, I decided to try the Balance. So here\\'s my review. The watch is large. At least for me, but the screen is amazing! Clear, easy to read, Amoled so the color is great. I chose to use the \\'use your own photo\\' watch face which is new (I think) for Amazfit and I like it. There are several others to choose from and if they stay true to form, more will be added. There are a lot of apps pre-loaded on the watch and a lot to choose from to load so that would probably appeal to many who will use this for fitness. I do not so I can\\'t speak to the fitness portion of the watch. I keep track of my steps/activity on the whole, but not any specific exercise. I got the watch on September 2nd, charged it, and with all of the heart associated apps turned on to run all the time (including running the heart rate monitor every 60 seconds,) I didn\\'t have to charge it until the 11th, and even then, I was still at 18%, but we were going on vacation, so the battery life is great. Like I mentioned, the watch is huge, at least for me. It\\'s 46mm, but light weight, so I don\\'t really notice it much. It has a relatively slim profile on the wrist so I\\'m not banging into things with it like I thought I would. I did change the band to a stainless steel one because any silicone bands cause a rash for me. Those are the basics. Here\\'s some of the pros and cons. PROS: Huge, clear, bright face that\\'s easy to read, even for people who need glasses. Several watch faces to choose from including one you can personalize. Big plus!

       "  'reviewText': \"Wow, I am really loving the Amazfit Balance.  For me battery life was very important, many of the main brand smart watches can't last a day between charges.  I have already gone more than a full week (full 7 days and a few hours) on my first charge & I still have 28% battery life.  I have Always On Display ON during the day, and off at night.  If I had AOD only ON as needed, this watch probably lasts a full 2 weeks between charges.  It is not as full featured as other smart watches, but it does what I need it to.  I don't need it to be a full smart device, that is what my smart phone is for.  Great for fitness tracking & sleep monitoring.  Also impressed with offline map loading & ability to navigate.  Created GPX file for navigation on a backcountry camping trip & uploaded to the watch.  Very impressed!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I purchased the Amazfit Balance Smart Watch back in July 2024, and I can honestly say it has become an indispensable part of my daily life. In fact, I love this watch so much that it's the only one I wear. It has completely replaced any other timepieces I owned. What truly stands out about the Amazfit Balance is its incredible versatility and performance. From tracking my daily activity levels and sleep patterns to providing insightful health metrics, it does everything I need and more. The accuracy of the step counting, heart rate monitoring, and sleep analysis has been consistently impressive. It provides a comprehensive overview of my well-being that encourages me to stay active and mindful of my health. The battery life is also a major highlight. I typically only need to take it off to charge, which is usually every few days depending on my usage. This minimal downtime is fantastic and means it's almost always on my wrist and tracking my data. The only other time it leaves my wrist is when I shower, simply out of habit and to keep it in pristine condition. Beyond the fitness and health tracking, the smartwatch features are incredibly useful. Receiving notifications for calls, texts, and apps directly on my wrist is convenient and allows me to stay connected without constantly checking my phone. The ability to control music playback and access other handy tools directly from the watch face is also a great bonus. The design of the Amazfit Balance is sleek and comfortable for all-day wear. The display is clear and easy to read even in bright sunlight, and the responsiveness of the touchscreen is excellent. The build quality feels premium and durable, reassuring me that it can withstand daily wear and tear. Honestly, the Amazfit Balance has far exceeded my initial expectations. It's not just a smartwatch; it's a comprehensive health and lifestyle companion that seamlessly integrates into my daily routine. For anyone looking for a reliable, feature-rich, and long-lasting smartwatch, I wholeheartedly recommend the Amazfit Balance. It has truly become my go-to timepiece, and I can't imagine my day without it.\",\n",

That said - I am disappointed with the tracking. Pros: Battery life Appearance (I have swapped my band for a nylon 22mm and it\\'s very comfortable) Circle shape face fits my wrist better Easily connects to my Bluetooth to read texts, WhatsApp, Messenger, Teams, etc. Cons: Does not accurately track sleep - counts reading as sleep, and even sometimes as deep sleep. Sleep tracker is basically useless. Does not track all my steps - I am 5-2\" and my husband is 5-11\" and I am consistently hundreds of steps off his on our evening walk. Heart rate monitor is not accurate. I really wanted to specifically track my steps and sleep - so I feel that I will be returning this watch for a better one.  It was $40CAD.  I guess you get what you pay for :(',\n",

The Customer Service has been great to deal with and will be sending a replacement watch.  I have therefore updated my rating.  and recommend purchasing this watch. I purchased this watch in July - two months ago.  I was looking for a round-faced smart watch as the square/rectangle ones didn't sit properly on my wrist.  This one worked fine for about a month, then the battery started to lose its charge.  I haven't been using many of the functions as it seemed to add to the draining of the battery.  I charged the watch on Thursday and it was dead my mid-morning Sunday.  Too late to return as the window closed one month after purchase.  Wouldn't recommend as a result.\",\n",

This looks pretty good on battery, only used 15% in over 12 hours and that included setting up and have a good play and explore of the watch. You can't reply to texts which I would prefer and you can't view emails, only the title but that's manageable I think. Tracks steps well and logged my workout after I manually started it. I'd prefer auto recognising exercise but the missing features are reflected in the price. Fits well. I like the idea of adding a photo for the background but it is only 1 photo unfortunately.For the money this watch seems pretty spot on.  A few days later and the battery was still going strong, I think it would've managed 4 days but I'm afraid to say I sent it back as it wasn't tracking steps correctly. It's a shame because it was a nice watch and all other features seemed to be spot on.\",\n",

L'orologio è veloce, performante, e la batteria dura tantissimo (ho ricevuto lo smartwatch al 66%, dopo una settimana è al 50%). Il cinturino è molto comodo, confortevole e non irrita la pelle (come mi è successo per altri orologi). Il quadrante è un po' grande (vedere foto), c'è da dire però che ho il polso piccolo. Ma nonostante questo ci si abitua ed è molto leggero. L'applicazione è molto comoda, di facile utilizzo e ha tante funzioni sport.

       "  'reviewText': 'Die Smartwatch ist zweifellos ein bemerkenswertes Angebot in der Low-Budget-Kategorie, und das zu einem Preis von nur etwa 50 Euro. Mit einem fast 2 Zoll großen Display überrascht diese Uhr in ihrer Preisklasse und bietet eine beeindruckende visuelle Erfahrung. Das Display ist hochauflösend, man erkennt bei genauem Hinschauen dennoch die einzelnen Pixel. Ein herausragendes Merkmal dieser Smartwatch ist zweifellos die phänomenale Akkulaufzeit. Mit 30 Tagen Standby-Zeit und 7 Tagen täglicher Nutzung muss man sich nicht ständig Sorgen um das Aufladen machen, was sie zur idealen Begleitung für einen aktiven Lebensstil macht. Die Benutzeroberfläche der Uhr ist angenehm flüssig und reaktionsschnell. Dies ist besonders bemerkenswert, wenn man bedenkt, dass sie in einer niedrigeren Preisklasse angesiedelt ist. Jedoch gibt es auch einige Nachteile. Das Fehlen von GPS ist enttäuschend, insbesondere für Sportler, die ihre Aktivitäten verfolgen möchten. Die deutsche Übersetzung der Benutzeroberfläche und der zugehörigen App lässt auch zu wünschen übrig, was die Gesamterfahrung leicht trübt. Dennoch bietet die Uhr einige beeindruckende Funktionen, darunter Bluetooth-Anrufe und Nachrichtenerinnerungen. Mit dem integrierten Lautsprecher können Sie qualitativ hochwertige Anrufe führen, während Ihr Telefon in der Tasche bleibt. Das war überraschend angenehm und ich vermisse diese Funktion für gewöhnlich bei Produkten anderer Hersteller. Der Activity and Fitness Tracker überwacht die Herzfrequenz, den Sauerstoffgehalt im Blut und den Schlaf in Echtzeit, was dabei hilft, einen gesünderen Lebensstil zu entwickeln. Die IP68-Wasserdichtigkeit macht diese Uhr zu einem idealen Begleiter für sportliche Aktivitäten. Der 1,9 Zoll große Bildschirm bietet eine hervorragende Anzeige, und Sie haben die Wahl aus über 200 Zifferblättern, die sich in der App herunterladen lassen. Die Batterielebensdauer ist beeindruckend, und es gibt eine Fülle von Funktionen, darunter Musiksteuerung, Wettervorhersage und mehr. Insgesamt bietet die TRUEFREE GT1 Smartwatch ein beeindruckendes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis und eignet sich gut für diejenigen, die nach einer kostengünstigen Smartwatch suchen. Trotz kleinerer Mängel ist sie eine solide Wahl, insbesondere für diejenigen, die ihre Fitnessaktivitäten verfolgen und Anrufe direkt vom Handgelenk entgegennehmen möchten.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Da gusto cuando compras algo que en el nombre no solo da a entender que es la siguiente version en este caso de este reloj inteligente de la marca de TrueFree sino que realmente es ese upgrade que se ve en el nombre. Que decir, vengo de tener el GT1 el cual la mas notoria diferencia es que es de forma cuadrada contra este GT2 que es circular pero mas alla de solo la apariencia estetica es muy notorio las funciones asi como lo pulido que se ha vuelto la interfase del dispositivo amen que subjetivamente hablando a mi en lo personal me gusta mas el que ahora sea redondo. Cuenta con una excelente pantalla de gran tamaño en la que se despliegan de forma muy nitida las notificaciones y ahora cuenta con una mayor personalizacion en lo que a brillo se refiere lo cual se agradece muchisimo, en el tema de la bateria estamos bien cubiertos con un promedio en uso normal de alrededor de 1 semana, sus funciones son muy variadas inclusive mayormente si lo comparamos con su predecesor y ahora cuentan con su propia aplicacion cosa que anteriormente dependian de una app que era de su compañia hermana cosa que ahora ya no sucede la cual creo yo la pulieron mucho pues si noto diferencia en como se presentan todas las opciones de configuracion del reloj y pues la verdad se agradece cuando menos en mi caso que me encanta personalizar lo mas posible las cosas. El equipo se carga con un cable que va por debajo de la caja del reloj de forma magnetica (ojo con no usar un cargador de demasiada potencia ya que lo recomendable es de 1 amperio y 5 volts) asi como directamente a la entrada USB de la compu, la carga toma aproximadamente un par de horas asi que la verdad creo yo es lo suficientemente rapida a mi parecer. Al usarlo como manos libres que una de las cosas que mas me gustan suena a buen volumen y de forma nitida, eso si, en el celular le apague la opcion de reproduccion de medios ya que para eso tengo mis auriculares para escuchar musica y pues no soy afin de escuchar mi musica a traves de la bocina del reloj obviamente. La conectividad es fuerte y es facil de llevar a cabo, la primera vez es un poco \"larga\" la configuracion pero se debe mas que nada a que la personalizacion es muy completa y de verdad sugiero que cuando la hagan se tomen su tiempo para que vean la cantidad de elementos necesarios para ello, eso si en el celular permitan que la aplicacion se inicie de forma automatica ya que si cierran en el menu de tareas en segundo plano todo pues no les llegaran las notificaciones, una forma facil de resolverlo es con el inicio automatizado de la aplicacion y si no les gusta ver en la parte de arriba de la pantalla el aviso de que la aplicacion esta en funcionamiento pues en el apartado de notificaciones de la aplicacion pueden irse a mas notificaciones y esa la apagan para que no aparezca arriba en la barra del celular pero aun asi les estaran llegando las notificaciones, es por ello que menciono que hay que tomarse su tiempo por primera vez en poner todo en orden y una vez haciendo todo eso cranme que lo van a disfrutar mucho. El reloj es sumergible y su calidad es muy buena, sus extensibles son intercambiables ya que son de tamaño estandar de 20-22 mm por lo que si no les gusta mucho la de neopreno que tiene de fabrica pues bien pueden optar por otra aqui la ventaja es que es facil de combinar pues la caja del reloj es grafito el cual es un color muy elegante y de buena contruccion. La pantalla es muy responsiva y de excelente calidad. Creo eso es todo lo que puedo decir de este excelente Reloj Inteligente de la marca TrueFree que pues la verdad vino a suplir mi anterior GT1 el cual creo lo regalare ya que este nuevo en lo personal me gusto mucho... si estan viendo la opcion de comprarlo de verdad vale mucho la pena no solo por sus fuciones sino por el respaldo de la marca asi como tener a lo que a mi parecer es las 3B. Si llegaste hasta aqui te agradezco mucho el que hayas leido mis comentarios de este producto y espero te hayan sido de gran utilidad, si tienes dudas tratare de responder cuando vea preguntas al respecto... un saludo y felices compras!!!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"After a problem with getting the watch to connect to the app, we contacted support. They did respond within a day and said it'd be a couple of days for developers to fix the issue. Sure enough, the issue seems to be resolved. Now that it is connected, the watch is working and has features of much higher end watches, including a pretty vibrant face. I am still learning all it offers but it seems like it will do what I need. I really only got it to track steps and receive phone notifications. Time will tell.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Fantastic piece of technology. I was initially skeptical on how such a decently priced piece would perform in comparison to established and branded ones. After using it for 3 days itself my opinion had changed; but I was very hesitant to accept the fact that truth is always bitter. Wonderful device. It does all what it claims, that too perfectly. Pros: 1. All chosen notifications were Pushed literally \"faster\" than real time. 2. The small grip feature on the strap holder is an amazing discovery. Holds the strap tight. 3. Does not need any costly model unless you are a brand freak Cons: 1. Strap lock felt mis-aligned by a degree initially but fell in place after 2-3 days probably due to wear and tear. 2. There seems to be inaccuracies capturing sleep data. 3. Felt that Trufree sport app drained mobile battery more even when not connected. 4. Kept loosing track of outdoor walking/running data after pausing for a break. Hope another app update can help. 5. Could not figure out how to measure BP though it\\'s mentioned as available 6. Few texts /messages on App could have been worded better. The width of the case can be reduced to match the size of the watch. Would look unique, buts its only a suggestion. Overall a decent buy. Go for it.',\n",

I kept mulling over whether to give this product a 4 or 5 star. There are aspects of the UI and app that require some additional polish, but those are counterbalanced by a very feature packed device with good hardware for the price and backed by a reputable company. The build quality of the device is very good. Metal frame and clasps with a sturdy glass front - no scratches yet. The strap is comfortable and easy to adjust and works for even narrow and thicker wrists. The charger is magnetic and latches onto the back, some stronger magnets or a flatter charger would be appreciated as it often gets knocked off. The display is an okay resolution LED. Edges of text and numbers have some aliasing but even fine text is still perfectly legible. No OLED but that's reasonable given the size and price of the display. The display itself is snappy and responsive and scrolling is smooth. Lift to turn on is also very responsive. There is no ambient light sensor so no automatic brightness adjustment - only manual. However the display is more than bright enough to easily read is full direct sunlight. The heart rate sensor is very accurate, and for spot measurements was regularly within 1 BPM (margin of error given watch strap tightness) of my Amazfit band and Kardia. Both spot heart rate measurement, stress, and SPO2 are slower compared to my Amazfit band, about on par with my Mi Bands. SPO2 measurement doesn't account for movement, so measurements aren't quite accurate. I walk a lot with a stroller, and step counting is significantly more accurate than my Mi Band or Amazfit bands which often account for 50% of the steps walked when pushing a stroller. However the watch is sensitive to normal hand movement - playing with my baby on the floor my step counters do continue to rise. At the end of the day they can be as much as 15% more than other counters due to additional hand movement. The app was easy to use, pair, and remains synced with my phone. Background battery usage is fairly high - on a day where I didn't open the app once it drained about 8% of my battery which I don't see with the Zepp life app. The app is chock full of features - although there are some items missing that are present on the watch. It would be good to see brightness adjustment in app. Another nice to have a would be time range on lift to turn on display separate from DND. It would also be nice to have the ability to hide or rearrange apps on the watch through the app for more seamless use. There is plenty of fitness data available on the app and it's presented in an easy to read way. Great job here. The watch UI is great. Easy to navigate and smooth. I love that within this price range you get things like SPO2, media control, and full phone call support. Audio in and out are very clear, top notch. Overall this a great effort by Truefree. The device is packed with great hardware and software features. There is a little bit of app polish missing that would take this well above competitors selling at 3x the price, but for now this is a must buy for anyone looking for a budget, entry level smart band to dominate the increasingly more expensive fitness band market.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is my 4th watch in the last 2 years. I have not had much luck with the features, I gave them to Family members. I googled budget friendly smartwatches, a review of about 10 watches showcased this watch with a good rating. I went to Amazon, also read reviews, plus the price is amazing. Delivered next day to my cottage was a great option. The watched linked easily and setup was quick and simple. It said it has over 200 dial faces. I love to change the face to match an outfit along with the band colour. I only had 18 faces that I did not like. I emailed the watch company, they responded right away, they gave advice and said if I had further trouble video the problem and send to them for further help. That is amazing customer service. I now have close to 300 amazing faces and found I could even make a custom face. The picture I attached is my Maine Coon as my watch face, I am thrilled.  All sports features are great, the phone calls are clear as can be, I get phone, email, SMS on my watch instantly with no problems. I can not say enough good, BUY THIS WATCH!!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'First Impressions On opening the box I noted the watch was very well protected. It is a very nice looking watch and feels nice to the touch. I do not usually get on with silicone wrist strap however the one on GT1 has a very nice feel and fit. The watch look a bit bulky but its is OK for the average wrist. It feels much like my Apple watch series 8. My Experience When you first take the watch out of the box. The first think I did was to charging the watch, it was showing it was at 79% so it was fully charged in about 12 minutes using 5 Volt 500 Ma USB charger. You need to install the SoundPeats Sports app on your smartphone. I used my Samsung S22 Ultra and installed SoundPeats Sports app from (google play store) You will then need to register the SoundPeats Sports app account with a valid email account to which you will receive code to complete your SoundPeats account registration. Enable Bluetooth on your smartphone and Location so you can continue the setup and you are ready to start using the watch. I did find setup on the Samsung S22 Ultra to be easy and connected first time but on a Huawei P30 I needed to pare the GT1 manually. Usage Using the GT1 easy to use, but did find the some of the screen swiping to take a bit of time to get used too. I found the Vibration to be a bit harsh. The sleep activity work just fine with the default settings. I set GT1 for walking and tested against my Apple series 8 watch and found the GT1 to be only 21 steps behind the Apple watch after a 4 mile walk, the Heart monitor was very accurate and Blood oxygen like wise very accurate. I did find the Huawei P30 was very hot to the touch on all my tests. One think I found not so good was the responsiveness of the watch, it did not miss a tap, just wish it was a bit faster. I think its something you would get used to in time, as I’m used to the Apple watch You will find there lots of watch face to try just open the app on your smartphone and go to Device on the menu bar and touch on Watch faces pick the watch you like synchronous dial, to remove Watch faces go to My dial and touch Edit Battery I found the battery was very good, in that I used the watch for a full week and it only went down by 32% however this dependent on how you use your watch. The charging is very quick, I used a 5 volt 500ma USB charger. Conclusion If your just looking for a fitness tracker you can not go wrong at this price.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This watch puts everything at your fingertips and paired with the APP has historical and robust connectivity features! I am loving the watch. From the moment I put it on, the watch has been incredibly comfortable for me, especially with the band allowing very small incremental size changes. The screen is crisp, clear and responsive.  [Apologies for how much I wrote here! I was keeping notes for myself and turned that into this! There is so much detail about what this swatch does, that I don't even cover it all!] I was happy to find that there are many things this watch does well, including: tracking sleep, periodic and on-demand blood oxygen saturation readings, and displaying continuous heart rate, as well as displaying all the metrics daily and historically. Showing HR and HR zones during exercise/training on the watch face is done simply. The APP allows a mostly intuitive interaction with everything. Receiving texts and seeing who is calling you (if in your synced contacts) without taking out your phone is a plus. The ability to exchange watch faces on the fly from the app and phone is nice (though I don't seem to be able to store all MyDial faces on the phone, still figuring it out.) Importantly, no subscription to see and access your own data and it has LOOOONG battery life (its Day 9 and I am at 43%!!!!). I should note that I am an exercise physiologist and athlete and I value having easy access to my training and recovery information. I like being able to assess my fitness and my state, and I like to challenge myself and see if I have maintained and improved. I typically use a chest strap connected to an APP to track exercise, a sleep APP to track sleep, and a separate device for measuring blood  oxygen saturation. So, it was nice to have all these together in one place on the watch. In addition to the health and fitness options, the watch has lots of other functions. The watch operates smoothly, with down, up, left and right swipes bringing up the different screens, some of which have additional swipe screens, which are indicated on side (up/down) or bottom (left/right) when available. By default, the screen stays lit about 10 seconds without interaction, which has been plenty of time to see or start to navigate to what I need. This can be set to 5, 10  or 15 seconds in the swipe right menu under “Settings” (at the bottom of the menu). Clicking the button on the watch takes you up one level or the watch face. If I swipe down there is a menu with basic control option buttons (such as phone, menu list style, don’t ring, screen brightness, wrist flick activation). There is a left-swipe screen indicated and if I then swipe to the left…there are option buttons to change the watch screen’s brightness, engage a full watch face “flashlight” or  make my phone ring if I misplaced it. There is also a “Toolbox” with a stopwatch and timer as well as also linking the Flashlight and Find Phone options, both of which I use more than I should need to! Swiping left from the clock face screen goes through the daily exercise screen with estimated steps, estimated distance and estimated calories info. The next left swipe brings you to phone call controls. The next swipes take you to Heart Rate, Sleep, Blood oxygen, music, and weather panels.  Heart Rate, and  Sleep allow scrolling down for detail windows. The watch arrived nicely packaged. On removing from the box there was a simple protective cover for glass and backside sensor. The watch was completely uncharged when it arrived and took 2-hours to charge to 100%. The watch clearly displays the charge % on the screen during charging if you press the side button. Some watch faces also show your charge % remaining, its up to you what you see based on your choice of watch face design. On turning the watch on, it immediately showed the QR code to scan to download the app. This was very fast. On opening the APP there was a fast process to pair the phone with the watch. Finding a personal watch face in the APP was very simple, I just kept scrolling down until I found what I wanted. I selected it, it synced with the phone in about 30 seconds, and was done. My Dial choices are saved in My Dial in the “Dash Board” on the APP so I can change when I want. I like to switch depending on what I am doing! In addition to time on a watch face with hands, I like to see heart rate, charge remaining, month, day, and day of the week. I found both a simple moon and a cyberpunk watch face that I really like and have the information I want. The watch charging is via a USB-A cable that is about 12 inches long. The phone charging end is via a magnetic connector attached to the back of the watch, so charging requires that the watch be removed. The magnetic binding is strong enough not to disconnect when you casually move the watch around. The Phone calls, texts, notifications (I am on Apple!): All these require that you have Bluetooth on and enabled between the watch and phone/APP. Calling out and answering the phone on the watch are very easy and the audio can remain on the phone or a headset, or it can be swapped to the watch! The watch audio is clear enough. It is quite convenient  to look at the watch and see who is calling or has texted without taking the phone out. I can receive my “Messages” texts, though without photos, but can not respond to them on the watch (Android users can). THE APP: On the APP screen at the bottom are Home, Sport, Device and Profile. >DEVICE Most of the settings for the watch are in the APP under Device.  Many can also be disabled/enabled on both phone and APP! • Bluetooth Call – sync contacts (choose which to Sync for call ID)? Enable/Disable Calls? • Dash Board -  where the watch faces are. Swipe up to load more. • Heart Rate Settings  - detect over 24 hours or not? Notify of maximum HR is exceeded? • Blood oxygen settings – Automatic? When to test? How often to test? • Phone – should the watch vibrate with incoming calls? Requires Bluetooth is on. • APP – what apps can interact via Bluetooth…must stay Bluetooth connected. • Sedentary Reminder – should the phone alert you? What intervals? Between What hours? • Alarms – set complex alarm schemes. • Light up – Turn off or on the watch face activating up when you flick your arm. • Do not disturb – Set a time range to disable vibration, screen lighting, and info pushing • More Settings – SMS?, 24-hour clock? Language? • Firmware Update – seamless updates • Reset Device – resets to factory and unpairs, but it quickly pairs and updates to the APP again. • Unpair >PROFILE Heart rate training zones are determined based on age and the calories reported are simply an estimated expenditure based on your age/bodyweight/steps, and steps are estimated based on arm movement, you can go into Profile under Profile and enter key values. >HOME The Home screen displays the current days: Steps with Step Goal, Distance and Calories, as well as panels for Heart Rate, Sleep, and Blood oxygen. Clicking Steps, Heart Rate, Sleep, or Blood oxygen panels opens the respective area where you can view different things for each. STEPS, DISTANCE AND ESTIMATED CALORIES Estimated steps, estimated distance and estimated calories are reported, though they are not the most realistic values to focus on for fitness, except for the most sedentary person. This section does have a summary that you can view for any day, week or month. This would allow identifying changes in average steps, distance and calories by scrolling through. There is also Todays data showing all the bouts of walking/running and “Other sources” with your other walking type workouts, but I will talk about this under SPORT. HEART RATE Records and displays heart rate 24/7. Allows reviewing HR history. Each day, a waveform of heart rate recording is plotted throughout the day on both the watch and the APP. Both present daily Minimum and Maximum as well as Average HR (watch shows a weekly average HR) and APP shows % in each Zone of HR Range for day. Currently, even the best sport watch devices have issues with HR measurement accuracy at higher intensity heart rates compared to chest straps. Interestingly, the watch got better as I used it. I am only a little hairy with fine hair, but I tried removing hair in the sensor area to see if this mattered. I think the accuracy at higher intensities is worst at low humidity and improves most when I am sweating/wet! My recent training has had the most accurate recordings, which included when I was training and sometimes followed by being in a sauna, where the watch tracked my heart rate quite accurately for periods over an hour between 60 and  90% HR max. Bravo!! One of the most important metrics on the watch could be Heart Rate as it is an actual readout of activity intensity. The newest studies show that EVERY WEEK accumulating a mix of 150 minutes of FAT BURNING and CARDIO [Moderate] and/or 75 minutes of ANAEROBIC and EXTREME [Vigorous] heart rate zones (as used on the APP!) leads to improved health outcomes, and these are the current WHO and USA CDC guidelines. I compared watch recorded HR values during training and rest to Wahoo Tickr chest strap recordings. SLEEP Sleep recording starts itself and was pretty spot on for start and end of sleep as well as being fairly accurate for total and other sleep information. The APP and watch show Averages for Sleep/Deep sleep/Light sleep/Awake/Rapid Eye Movement. SLEEP is an important metric on the watch and the APP allows viewing results for the last sleep day or any recorded day, or averages for any week or month. Since this can be used to roughly gauge sleep quality over time, it is nice that this does have these summaries. This has allowed me to identify changes in my sleep just by scrolling through. Week and month averages show Sleep/Deep sleep/Light sleep as well as early and late to-sleep and waking times! I compared watch recorded sleep to sleep recorded in Sleep Cycle using an iPhone. BLOOD OXYGEN Records and displays in a daily history at whatever intervals you select in the settings and also any spot tests you perform! This is well done. This can be a very important metric for athletes and those with respiratory conditions. Athletes and those who train hard or have a lot of stress can combine sleep and Blood oxygen measures to understand their recovery or state! Further, blood oxygen levels can indicate how much oxygen is reaching muscles during intense exercise.  So, looking at sleep values, testing on waking, plus during and after exercise can be informative! Fortunately, the APP and watch allow you to do a SPOT TEST whenever you want! On the watch, you swipe to Blood oxygen or choose it from the menu! In the APP there is a “Start” test button at the bottom of the Blood oxygen screen. In the APP it may ”fail” at first, just repeat it. The watch will start checking and then will vibrate when it is done. Tests get a time stamp. What could be interesting, would be the option to tag a spot readings for Waking, Mid Workout, Post Workout, etc for the APP to include in a plot and comparison over time. >SPORT When I swipe R and select TRAINING and then choose a type of workout on the watch from the list, the watch will start to display the duration and HR performance during the training. If I happen to choose a type of training recognized by both watch and APP, it will sync some aspects of the session to the APP, but into the tab for that type of workout and sometimes in “Other sources” in the Steps window if it is a walking/hiking type workout. This need to be simplified into a single workout list by date. If you can find your training in “Other sources” in the Steps window, it will provide steps, cals, duration, miles and then heart rate average, minimum, maximum and charted in workout minutes. Retaining the HR training zones would be more useful for me.  Especially since training HR is excluded from the daily total! The syncing of training from watch to APP does not always work. Once I end some of the training types, the record will VANISH. There will be no history under the sport tab and there is nothing in “Other sources” in the Steps window. Other things I have noticed are that the HR recorded during training is EXCLUDED from your ongoing HR recording for the day. Though, any Blood oxygen measures I may have taken, ARE integrated into the list on that window for the day. The workout session and any information are not retained at all in some training modalities that are on the watch but are not in the APP! Currently, this is an under-served section. There are many types of sport to add (via the APP) to the sport list by looking at the “+” at the top, there,  select the ones you want to appear in the Watch. REMOVE the ones you don’t want. I found this to be a bit buggy. It would show 3 Yoga and 1 of something I did not select… etc. You can start the exercise in the APP to insure it saves the record, but this is not what I got a sport watch for. Huge thumbs up and I look forward to some adjustments in later software updates.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Me he llevado una grata impresión con éste smartwatch, lo primero, su tamaño, un poco mas grande que otros como Amafit GTS3, y un detalle que tras usar otros relojes me ha encantado, un botón plano que no interfiere con la mano al doblar la muñeca por ejemplo al hacer flexiones y que hacían que otros relojes se pulsara accidentalmente. Por otro lado, las llamadas se escuchan realmente bien, si, directamente en el teléfono, puedes contestar directamente con él, además de poder incluir contactos frecuentes en la agenda. Como pulsómetro, es bastante fiable la información, dando valores reales . Además, sirve como reproductor de la música del móvil. En definitiva, mismas o parecidas prestaciones que otros smartwatch de gama media pero a un precio bajo. Realmente encantado con el dispositivo.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Bought this watch few weeks back, and have loved using it. It is a great smartwatch at this price range. Found it very easy to setup and connect with my iphone using the QR code - it uses iphone app called SPORTS from Soundpeats. Phone app is really good - simple interface and very easy to use. The watch itself has a very nice feel to it - big, crisp and easy to ready display. Can choose from several watch faces providing information, such as time, heart rate, step, calories and watch battery status. The phone app shows all of the above plus sleep tracker and blood oxygen level. It has amazing battery life, easily lasts for a week. I have used it to track workouts, have several modes such as running, walking, cycling, yoga, etc. Found it very useful as it provides a lot of information. It provides an alert for incoming call and messages. Found the sedentary reminder very good, it reminder to move about if remain sitting for a long time (you can set the time). Overall, a fabulous smartwatch at this price range.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'En mi día a día me veo en la necesidad de trasladarme constantemente a través de la ciudad, por motivos de trabajo, escuela y demás asuntos personales. Jamás había pensando en adquirir un Smart Watch con anterioridad porque consideraba que era un accesorio innecesario debido a que las funciones que yo conocía de un Smart Watch, fácilmente las podía realizar en el celular. Pero decidí darle la oportunidad a comprar un Smart Watch y verificar si mantenía mi opinión respecto a la utilidad que pudieran llegar a tener en mi día a día. Para empezar, soy una persona que jamás ha estado acostumbrada a utilizar reloj, por lo cual resulta inevitable tener que tomarse un par de días para poder acostumbrarse. Pero ayuda muchísimo el hecho de que la correa que trae al estar hecha de materiales que resultan cómodos para la piel puedas acostumbrarte más rápido. Además, de que la correa permite apretar o aflojar el reloj de manera bastante suave. Lo que hace que la experiencia de tenerlo puesto, no resulte engorroso, molesto o que sientas incomodidad. Un punto a destacar de este reloj, y que quiero decir desde el ya, es que resulta bastante sencillo de configurar y poderlo enlazar con tu celular. Y resalto esto, porque he tenido amigos que me han contado que la configuración inicial con su Smart Watch resulto un tanto compleja, por las herramientas que trae. Pero en mi caso, resulto en una experiencia sencilla y sin sobresaltos que me permitió elegir parámetros del reloj que se ajustaran a mi día a día. En cuanto a las herramientas que trae, dependerá de cada uno a cuales le da más importancia. En general este reloj cuenta con las siguientes herramientas: Hora del día, ritmo cardiaco, distancia recorrida, calorías empleadas, puedes ver tus mensajes y notificaciones de las redes sociales, puedes realizar llamadas, cuenta con un cronometro, temporizador, y demás funciones. La bateria tarda dos horas en llenarse y al menos a mi me duro 3 días sin tener que cargarlo. Si eres alguien adepto al ejercicio, considero que es una opción excelente este reloj, porque te permite llevar en tiempo real tus estadísticas como lo son cantidad de pasos, distancia recorrida, ritmo cardiaco, oxigenación, calorías empleadas, e incluso trae una herramienta donde dependiendo el tipo de actividad a realizar  (Sean diferentes deportes individuales o grupales) puedes ajustar tus parámetros para llegar a tu meta ideal diaria. También este reloj, cuenta con una aplicación que se llama \"Soundpeats Sport\" la cual es la que te lleva en el paso a paso en la configuración de este reloj, que como mencione lo hace bastante ameno, Y hay que destacar que la aplicación te da información más detallada respecto a los parámetros al momento de realizar ejercicio que mencione anteriormente, por lo cual si requieres un análisis más detallado la aplicación sounpeats sports, puedes revisarlo. Y como penúltimo punto, una características que creó que para deportistas y no deportistas resulta importante en un reloj de este tipo es ¿Se puede controlar la música de manera adecuada?. Y mi respuesta es si. Puedes conectar tu Smart Watch y tus audífonos blueetoth al celular al mismo tiempo, y no vas a tener ningún problema de interferencia y la respuesta que tiene el reloj a opciones de controlar la musica como lo son \"Adelantar, Pausar o Retroceder\" Bajar o subir el volumen son bastante suaves lo que hace que sea una experiencia agradable poder controlar tu música desde el reloj. Entonces, respondiendo a la cuestión inicial, un Smart Watch facilito e hizo más agradable y sobretodo resulto util en mi día a día?. La respuesta es que después de unos días que te acostumbras, pues si, resulta más fácil y de utilidad de lo que uno podría imaginar. Y esto es debido a que, como muchas personas que viven en una ciudad con un acelerado ritmo de vida, algunas veces sacar el celular en determinados lados resulta imposible, ya sea que porque vas en un transporte muy lleno, vas corriendo o simplemente por comodidad no lo haces, y este reloj te permite ver desde la hora, tus mensajes, contestar llamadas,  realizar llamadas, poder controlar tu música  de una manera más sencilla. Eso lo cumple a la perfección. Ahora si lo compras por el ámbito deportivo. no dudo que resulte adecuado para este uso, ya que con todas las herramientas que trae, te da un montón de información. Así que en resumen, si buscas un Smart Watch, que sea cómodo y fácil de usar, sin duda este es una gran opción para empezar.',\n",

This smartwatch is a game changer for both kids and parents! Watch is amazing with good features. It comes with an installation note with clear instructions on how to contact support and how they will help to setup the watch. The support was always available for any guidance with prompt responses on email and / or WhatsApp. He helped me right from setting up to testing. Watch is good to keep in touch with the child on call, video call, sms, and GPS tracking feature which is fairly accurate. Simple to use. Overall this smartwatch is the perfect balance between a toy and a practical device for parents. It’s not just a fun gadget; it’s a tool for safety and communication. My child enjoys it, and I’m confident it’s giving them a sense of independence while keeping me connected and reassured. I highly recommend the 4G GPS Smart Watch for Kids to any parent looking for a reliable and secure option for their little one!',\n",

The replacement watch is not able to charge. Change different charging cables with same issue. Can’t charge = end of story. Very disappointment experience after all.

       "  'reviewText': \"Bought the watch in September. After two months and 3 SIM cards, it finally works. First time round, it was my bad. I got a non-VoLTE SIM card. Fixed that immediately. Got a new SIM card on a different network with VoLTE function. But lo and behold, it didn't work. And that marked the beginning of a 4 to 5-week nightmare of trying to troubleshoot this, which resembled Groundhog Day set against the backdrop of tech customer service. The responsiveness of the support was great. I could reach them via Amazon chat, text messages and Whatsapp. Less great was the fact that they kept telling to do the same things over and over again, even if I told them I literally just did it. The solutions seemed to be limited to the following: Insert SIM card properly until you hear a click. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. It didn't matter that I did everything that was asked of me and it still didn't work. The solutions suggested were consistently the same. Insert SIM card properly until you hear a click. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Doesn't work? Are you sure you inserted the SIM card properly until you hear a click? Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Please insert SIM card properly until you hear a click, otherwise it will not work. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Insert SIM card properly until you hear a click. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Doesn't work? Are you sure you inserted the SIM card properly until you hear a click? Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Please insert SIM card properly until you hear a click, otherwise it will not work. Call the watch with your mobile device. Reboot. Finally, it was confirmed: The SIM card I got worked fine on mobile devices but not on the watch. I guess some loves are just not meant to be. Just got a new line and SIM card with a different network and it works now. After 2 months and 3 SIM cards, we are finally able to use the watch. The network: Circles.Life. Considering how the watch troubleshooting experience went very much in circles, it makes sense they're compatible. In summary, the watch does not work with all network providers, at least here in Singapore. The above aside, the watch works fine. Only one significant beef: Whatsapp on the watch has a button which brings you to the top of the conversation but nothing to bring you to the end. So if you accidentally pressed the button, you'd have to scroll through the entire conversation to get to the end. Oh and you can't seem to delete messages either.\",\n",

Works better than the previous watch that my girl had. “myFirst Fone” was the previous watch and within two weeks, it has broken down and their customer service is beyond hope. This watch has not broken down yet in past month and I see it as a positive. Gps location is also more accurate than “myFirst ”.  Way for features on watch as well. Only gripe is the amount of ad on the parental app.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Been searching for a device for my eight year old and found this to be of great value! Easy to set up if you follow the step by step instructions. Initially, I opted for Heya sim but realised I have to top up either at the retailer or on Shopee (I don't have time for that). Then I found VIvifi plus at $9.08 a month subscription!! If you need assistance, seller is very responsive (he provides a WhatsApp number in case you have questions) The calls are very clear and tracking is pretty spot on. I have peace of mind now - my child will call and let me know where he is heading to and I can reach him anytime. Very happy with this purchase!! Update Few months down, the watch doesn’t charge - it got replaced - great service. Now (Nov ‘23) the app has advertisements and I can’t even log in! Filled in email to get verification code - didn’t work!  So my two cents? Look somewhere else, you get what you pay for. Five stars for customer service, two stars for the watch!\",\n",

Some things I experience with my purchase below. - watch comes with a long instruction (see the photo) warning you not to activate or use it before contacting them.  I would have never bought this if I had known this.  Go with more established sellers who sells products that actually work and do not require seller to remotely activate after asking 20 questions... - contact with the seller to get it activated required over 3 weeks of back and forth.  The seller seems to be in China and not check emails frequently.  I was repeated asked same questions over and over again about who the sim card carrier will be... Very frustrating to say the least - the app you need to use is riddled with ads and location tracking never worked for me (see the photo).  the app showed the watch being located somewhere in Chine and it doesn't update. There are way too many issues and I've already spent a lot of time working with the seller so I will stop here...  The return window unfortunately has closed while trying to make this work with the seller.  I wonder if that is part of their strategy....\",\n",

Singapore SIM card work very well, and I can call and receive call easily. GPS tracking is also accurate. The only thing to improve will be the volume of watch is rather soft outside maybe due to higher noise level outside even though I set it to the highest, while indoor the volume is perfectly fine. Johnny is very helpful by promptly response to technical questions and helping us to make the set up of watch hassle free. I truly appreciate his help.',\n",

Tracking of location and sound guardian are additional capabilities. Video calls should be used sparingly as they drain the battery quickly. I believe battery life is the main issue with such devices and watch needs to be charged minimally daily. Have not used other watches except for Jumpy which was lousy and cost more, but believe this watch has a very competitive price point. Support is also strong and the seller is most helpful. He will respond via WhatsApp within a few hours. Kudos to the makers and sellers for the effort put into the watch and the mobile app. 5 stars ⭐️',\n",
